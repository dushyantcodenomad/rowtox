							High-intensity intervals alternate bursts of extreme activity with recovery exercises to increase aerobic capacity and efficiency. Translation: you’ll burn more calories, improve endurance and have fun while you’re doing it!

						<h4 class="notopmarg">SAVE THE JOINTS</h4>
						<p class="bft_para">
							This is a smart workout – low-impact and form-centric to reduce the risk of injury while still providing a kick-ass workout. We made rowing central to our workout because it eliminates the force other cardio exercises put on your joints while still providing maximum burn.

							Each stroke on the row machine works 84% of your muscles for a true total body workout. By coupling rowing with complementary sculpting exercises, CITYROW hits every part of your body for head-to-toe toning – you’ll feel it in muscles you didn’t even know you had!

						<h4 class="notopmarg">ROWTOX FLOW</h4>
						<p class="bft_para">
							Starts with one interval of heart-pumping, total body cardio on our water-based rowing machines followed by vinyasa flow yoga, focusing on aligning your breath with movement. We call it the best of both worlds. Like salted caramel or cold-pressed cocktails, this unexpected combination results in a workout that you’ll wonder how you ever lived without.

						<h4 class="notopmarg ">FUNDAMENTALS</h4>

							This 50-minute workshop will introduce you to our WaterRower rowing machines and teach you the basics of proper rowing form. With class capacity capped at 10 people, the focus is on form and individualized attention. And don’t worry – while you’re learning, you will also be sweating. Not a prerequisite, but great for newbies as well as return clients who want deeper instruction on proper form.​
